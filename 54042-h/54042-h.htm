  <ul  class='ul_1'>
    <li>There are many inconsistencies in this text. The headings in the table of contents do
    not all match the actual headings in the text, and not all headings in the text are in
    the table of contents. There are variations in spelling, hyphenation and capitalization,
    missing punctuation, and possible repeated words, particularly in the transcriptions from
    the 1692 court proceedings. In the older text, the letters u/v and I/J are sometimes used
    differently than is done today. Aside from a small number of punctuation typos in the
    more modern part of the text, and the page and item number fixes noted below, all
    inconsistencies and variations have been left as in the original.

    <li>The page numbers in the Bibliography content list changed to reflect their actual
    page numbers in the book. A duplicate (3) in the Perley’s Chronological Chart section was
    changed to (2).

</div>

<p class='c005'>Greater Salem, the province of Governors
Conant and Endicott, is visited by thousands of
sojourners yearly. They come to study the
Quakers and the witches, to picture the manses
of the latter and the stately mansions of Salem’s
commercial kings, and breathe the salubrious air
of “old gray ocean.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The witchcraft “delusion” is generally the
first topic of inquiry, and the earnest desire of
those people with notebook in hand to aid the
memory in chronicling answers, suggested this
monograph and urged its publication. There is
another cogent reason: the popular knowledge
is circumscribed and even that needs correcting.</p>

<p class='c006'>This short history meets that earnest desire;
it gives the origin, growth, and death of the
hideous monster; it gives dates, courts, and names
of places, jurors, witnesses, and those hanged; it
names and explains certain “men and things”
that are concomitant to the trials, with which the
reader may not be conversant and which are
necessary to the proper setting of the trials in
one’s mind; it compasses the salient features of
witchcraft history, so that the story of the 1692
“delusion” may be garnered and entertainingly
rehearsed.</p>

<p class='c006'>The trials were all spread upon the records, word
for word. Rev. Samuel Parris, stenographer to
the court, says they were “taken down in my
characters written at the time,” barring, of course,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>the evidence by affidavits, which were written,
signed, and attested, and filed in the Clerk of
Court’s office, where they may now be seen.</p>

<p class='c006'>Great research has hitherto been made, keen,
sagacious acumen employed, and much written;
but the true criterion of judgment, a trial,—a
word for word trial,—has not before this been
published. Here, then, is the first opportunity
of readers to judge for themselves.</p>

<p class='c006'>The trials were unique. The court was without
authority; none of the judges, it is said, was
bred to the law; evidence was arbitrarily admitted
or excluded; the accused were not allowed
counsel in law or the consolation of the
clergy in religion.</p>

<p class='c006'>The careful reader may discover, between the
lines, in questions, in answers, and in the strange
exhibitions, the real state of mind pervading all,
which has been mildly characterized as a “delusion”;
also he may be able to compare the
Mosaic, the 1692, and the modern spirit manifestations,
and advantageously determine for himself
what is worth while in modern spiritualism, mind-reading,
clairvoyance, mesmerism, and the rest.</p>

<p class='c006'>Though men of education, religion, titled
dignity, and official station, of the professions and
the élite, were responsible for the horrible catastrophy,
and in one instance or more forced the
yeoman jurors to convict (who at the end signed
recantations and expressed their grief),—religion
and education must not be undervalued; a religious
education will yield the highest type of manhood.</p>

  <h2 id='intro' class='c004'>INTRODUCTION</h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_0_4 c010'>The proceedings in witchcraft in 1692 to us
who are two hundred and twenty years
removed from the scene, seem, at first,
impossible, then mortifying, and persuasive of
disowning our fathers and forgetting the period
of their folly. At best, the occurrence furnishes
the wildest and saddest chapter in our New England
history.</p>

<h3 id='legalstatus' class='c011'><span class='sc'>Antiquity of the Witch <br /> and Her Legal Status</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>The doctrine of familiar spirits was current in
most ancient times. It is possible that immediately
after the fall in Adam the imprisoned spirit
of man began to assert its former freedom and
ability. The old Scriptures depicted the witch’s
character, gave warning of her blighting influence,
and enacted heavy penalties against employing
her agency. In Exodus, xxii. 18: “Thou shalt
not suffer a witch to live.” In Leviticus, xx. 27:
“A man also or a woman that hath a familiar
spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to
death; their blood shall be upon them.” In
Deuteronomy, xviii. 9-12: “When thou art come
into the land which the Lord thy God giveth thee,
thou shalt not learn to do after the abominations
of those nations. There shall not be found among
you any one that maketh his son or his daughter
to pass through the fire, or that useth divination,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>or any observer of times, or any enchanter, or a
witch, or a charmer, or a consulter with familiar
spirits, or a wizard, or a necromancer; for all that
do these things are an abomination unto the
Lord.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Colonial Laws and <br /> Their Biblical Origin</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>The colonial laws to which New England witches
were amenable, codified by Rev. Samuel Ward, of
Ipswich, who had had extensive legal training
and practice before entering the ministry, were
published in 1641. Mr. Ward<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c009'><sup>[2]</sup></a> followed Moses,
the great Hebrew lawgiver, in great measure, but
he distanced England in mildness and was far
ahead of his time in scope. With him, however,
the witch found no favor. Death was the punishment
for witchcraft, first and last, and the
Puritan, whose sure palladium of civil and religious
freedom was the Bible, obeyed the precept
to the letter, his highest knowledge and
authority.</p>

<h3 id='modern' class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Modern Witch and <br /> Her Terrible Persecution</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>The modern witch, it is said, had her birth near
the beginning of the Christian era. Her persecution
began about two hundred years later.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>From that time hundreds of thousands of victims
were immolated to appease the inconsiderate
and insatiate demands of her persecutors.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the earliest years witches were generally
burned, and in the first one hundred and fifty
years it is estimated thirty thousand thus perished.
Later, in France, in one century, an
almost incredible number suffered—one thousand
in a single diocese. In the century, 1600 to
1700, two hundred were hanged in England, one
thousand were burned in Scotland, and a much
greater number on the Continent.</p>

<h3 id='learnedviews' class='c011'><span class='sc'>The American Witch and <br /> Views of the Educated</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>In America there were witch trials—in Connecticut,
New York, and Pennsylvania,<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c009'><sup>[3]</sup></a>—some
years before 1692. In Boston, 1648, Margaret
Jones, of malignant touch, was hanged, and
Mrs. Ann (Wm.) Hebbins, in 1655. In Springfield,
1651, Mrs. Mary (Hugh) Parsons was
hanged. In Ipswich quarter court, 1652, a man
was sentenced to pay a fine of twenty shillings,
or to be whipped for “having familiarity with the
Devil.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The doctrine of witches was embraced not only
by the common people, but also by the learned;
Tycho Brahe, the prince of astronomers, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>Kepler, his student, Martin Luther, the bold
theologian, and Melancthon, the gentle; the
silver-tongued Dr. Watts and the pious Baxter,
who styled a disbeliever in witchcraft “an obdurate
Sadducee,” and others whom time fails me to
mention.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Old Crone Lore and <br /> Three Notable Dissenters</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>Witch stories were a social entertainment, to
the mingled fear and merriment of guests and
the positive foreboding of children. Who even
now among the older people has forgotten the
crone lore of our grandmothers—how witches
would seize a red-hot iron, glide into a heated
oven, ride through the air on enchanted broomsticks,
and how stalwart men would stalk through
keyholes, supported and directed by Satanic
power! It was believed that witches made an
actual, deliberate, and formal compact with Satan.</p>

<p class='c006'>There were, however, two or three persons of
learning and influence in the Province who (to
their great credit, be it said) dared to oppose the
doctrine of witches—the celebrated Rev. Samuel
Willard, of the Old South Church, Boston,—Maj.
Nathaniel Saltonstall, who declined a seat
upon the bench rather than participate in the
witch trials,—and Rev. John Higginson (son of
Rev. Francis, the first minister of Salem), who was
cautious and held himself aloof; for his conscience
whispered he had gone too far against the
Quakers.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>
  <h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Pen Picture of a Witch</span> <br /> <span class='sc'>Home of the “Delusion”</span></h3>
</div>

<p class='c012'>The New England witch was supposed to be an
old woman of attenuated form, somewhat bent;
clothed in lively colors and ample skirts; having a
darting and piercing eye, a head sporting disheveled
hair and crowned with a sugar-loaf hat, a
carlin’s cheek, a falcated chin bent to meet an
aquiline nose, by both of which was formed a
Neapolitan bay, her mouth in the background
resembling Vesuvius in eruption; and riding an
enchanted broomstick with a black cat as
guide.</p>

<p class='c006'>Salem Village, the location of the hideous
catastrophe, was the northern precinct of Salem;
and when it was incorporated Danvers, its name
became Danvers Center. Quite recently (1910)
the trolley car company changed the name to
Danvers Highlands, but in the steam car nomenclature
it is Collins Street. From Town House
Square in Salem to the Highlands a trolley ride
costs a nickel; the distance is five miles, and every
mile a pleasure.</p>

<h3 id='ingersoll' class='c011'><span class='sc'>Ingersoll and His Tavern</span> <br /> <span class='sc'>Revs. Bailey, Burroughs, Lawson</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>Nathaniel Ingersoll occupied the central location
in the village; a man of industry and thrift;
a licensed innkeeper, who sold liquor by the
quart on Sunday; a kind of chief of police; managed
the defenses against the Indians; a benevolent
man, and was chosen deacon. His name does
not figure in the witch trials, and the witches have
left no records of the influence of his tavern in the
results. The open plat of ground in front of his
tavern was called Ingersoll’s Common. Farther
up the street, at No. 5, is a plat of ground he gave
for “a training field forever.” Capt. Dea. Jonathan
Walcott was a neighbor, as was also Sergt.
Thomas Putnam, parish clerk.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>Rev. James Bailey, near his majority, a recent
graduate of Harvard, began to preach (not as
pastor) there in 1671, and created a division.
Rev. George Burroughs succeeded him in 1680,
but matters grew worse. In 1683 Rev. Deodat
Lawson began and gave no better results.</p>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Burroughs was a short, stout man, very
muscular and of very dark complexion. He was
a Harvard graduate of 1670. Most of the witches
knew him; and his complexion and extraordinary
strength argued his connection with the black
art and the muscular devil.</p>

<p class='c006'>Rev. Deodat Lawson (Deo-dat-um), a “God-given”
cataplasm for the tumor of unrest, social
discords, and animosities that had their rise in
Bailey’s ministry! With Lawson, the suppuration
began; for the deviltry had gone from <i>seance</i>
to families and the church, where the unwhipped
girls cried out from time to time, “enough of
that”; “see the yellow bird on the minister’s hat”;
“now name your text”; “look how she sits”;
to all which Mr. Lawson’s simplicity testifies:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>these things “did something interrupt me in my
first prayer, being so unusual.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>Rev. Samuel Parris, Student <br /> West Indian Trader, First Pastor</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>The wound was treated and cleansed during the
ministry of Rev. Samuel Parris. He was born
in London, about 1653, had been a merchant in
Boston and the Spanish Main, and had studied
at Harvard. He succeeded Mr. Lawson and was
ordained and installed their first pastor, Tuesday,
Nov. 19, 1689. He left in 1696. The unanimity
of the church since he left has been as marked as
the schism was before he left.</p>

<div id='il04'  class='figcenter id005'>
<img src='images/image018.jpg' alt='The Parris Meeting House, 1692' class='ig001' />
<div class='ic002'>
<p><span class='sc'>The Parris Meeting House, 1692</span></p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Mr. Parris’s home was at No. 4 on the map.
His house probably did not survive the year
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>1717. His meetinghouse stood a little to the
east of the Ingersoll Tavern, probably the flat
spot now marked by rose bushes and weeds, and
maybe by a large, flat stone in the wall, which
stone may have served as a doorstep. A beautiful
modern church edifice now graces the corner
opposite Ingersoll’s old corner, while the parsonage
occupies the Ingersoll site.</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>John and His Tituba</span> <br /> <span class='sc'>Rev. S. Parris’s Slaves</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>Mr. Parris brought with him from the Spanish
Main, as his slaves, a couple called John Indian
and his wife, Tituba. The ignorance of the
Spanish population found its summit of pleasure
in dancing, singing, sleight of hand, palmistry,
fortune-telling, magic, and necromancy (or spirit
communication with the dead); and John and his
Tituba in all those things were fully up to date.</p>

<h3 id='school' class='c011'><span class='sc'>Parris’s Witch School, Apt <br /> Pupils, Their Personnel</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>To the pastor’s house (as he wrote, “When these
calamities first began, which was at my house”)
the village maidens, by surreption, went under the
tuition of Tituba. Those of us who have some
remembrance of the rise of spiritualism, the
phenomenon of table-tipping, and the slightly
more refined practice of the élite with scribbling
planchet, can picture in some degree Tituba’s
pupils and how they got there.</p>

<p class='c012'>But, instead, Mr. Parris, in fashion of the
vaunted prowess of Cotton Mather and other
pedantic, astute, aspiring ministers, to show their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>efficiency in “casting out devils,” called in the
clergy, the deacons, and the elders, and held,
February 11th, a day of fasting and prayer.
“And still the wonder grew.”</p>

<h3 class='c011'><span class='sc'>A Portentous Leap Day <br /> “The Greatest Show on Earth”</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>It was high time, and some leading citizens
took the initiative. A complaint was lodged
against Tituba Feb. 25, 1692. The first warrants
were issued the 29th, the leap day of the year, and
Sarah Good, Sarah Osbun, and Tituba Indian
were apprehended. They were examined March 1st
and ordered to jail in Boston, to await the action
of the higher court.</p>

<p class='c006'>The examinations were to be held in Ingersoll’s
Tavern, but the crowd was so great on Ingersoll’s
Common, that the court adjourned to the meeting
house. The magistrates were John Hathorne
and Jonathan Corwin, assistants. They went
over from Salem, attended by the marshal, constables,
and their aids, and all of them arrayed
in the garb of court authority and the attractive
insignia of official station. Their advent into
the village was marked by an ostentation of whatever
grandeur and splendor they had at command.
To the gaping multitude it was “the greatest
show on earth,” while the trials proved a “Wild
West.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Sarah Good, a broken-down outcast, deserted
by her husband, begging food from house to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>house, was first examined; the last examined was
Tituba, the chief offender.</p>

<h3 id='usurpation' class='c011'><span class='sc'>Unwarrantable Usurpation <br /> Names of the Court and Jury</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>The Province took formal charge <i>in re</i> April 11,
1692. Simon Bradstreet was governor. He had
been honored with thirteen annual elections by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>the people to that office. He was then eighty-six
years of age, the “Grand Old Man” of his
time. He struck the keynote at first in an opinion
that the witch evidence was insufficient. With
honor crowned he passed into history as “The
Old Charter Governor.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The high action of Deputy-Governor Danforth
and his Counsel, who were the court, gave éclat
to the proceedings and consternation filled the
county. In October, 1691, a new charter was
signed, and Sir Wm. Phipps was appointed
governor. He arrived in Boston with the new
charter, Saturday, May 14, 1692. William Stoughton
was made deputy-governor, in place of
Thomas Danforth.</p>

<p class='c006'>In this change from popular government Increase
Mather, an early president of Harvard
College, was a “power behind the throne.” The
new charter had his approval and Sir Wm.
Phipps, its first governor, was his nominee.
Phipps was “a well-meaning man, inclined to
superstition,” and Mather admired his “incompetency.”
Stoughton was a man “of cold affections,
proud, self willed, and covetous of distinction,
and universally hated by the people.”
He was appointed deputy-governor to please
Cotton Mather, son of Increase. Cotton in his
race for glory ran amuck. He was a man of
“overweening vanity,” panting for fame, and the
strenuous mover in the trials. He harangued
the populace and sermonized on witchcraft; he
wrote a book: “The Trials of Witches,” and even
on horseback, at the hanging of Rev. George
Burroughs, he harangued the people gathered
there, lest they interfere and rob the gallows.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>By the new charter courts of justice were to be
established by the General Court. The witch
trials were, therefore, stranded and must remain
<i>in statu quo</i>, apparently, for several months, while
awaiting the action of the General Court. The
Governor, however, by “an unwarrantable
usurpation of authority,” organized a court of
final hearing, called <i>Oyer and Terminer</i>, to act
in the pending cases.</p>

<p class='c006'><a id='courtjury'></a>Deputy-Governor Stoughton was appointed
chief justice, and Nathaniel Saltonstall, of Haverhill,
who declined to serve, and was succeeded by

<p class='c006'>The commissions of the court were dated
Friday, May 27th; the court convened Thursday,
June 2d; Bridget Bishop, of Salem, was convicted
Wednesday, the 8th, and hanged Friday,
the 10th. The court, by adjournment, next sat
Wednesday, the 29th of June; then by several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>adjournments, it was to sit the 1st of November.</p>

<p class='c006'>The day on which Bridget Bishop was hanged,
June 10th, the General Court enacted a law of the
old charter for capital cases, and under it presumably
the subsequent witch trials were held,
while the personnel of the court remained the
same.</p>

the court. <i>Oyer and Terminer</i> was dissolved.

<h3 id='johnhale' class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Beginning of the End <br /> Rev. John Hale’s Change of Heart</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>Early in October, 1692, the wild and extravagant
methods of the court had penetrated every
community, and by relation or friendship, almost
every family, and too, accusations rested upon
families of the wealthy and the learned, of clergymen
and laymen, and even it was whispered upon
one of the judges of the court and the wife of the
governor; and it was only when the ruthless
authority of the law invaded those homes that
the fury of the storm abated. When Rev. John
Hale, of Beverly, who had been conspicuously
active in the convictions, found his wife in the
diabolical toils, he experienced a sudden change of
heart, and prayed for peace. The time was ripe;
Mr. Hale’s sentiments echoed from every home.
The establishment of the new court (Wm. Stoughton,
Chief Justice, Thomas Danforth, Wait Winthrop,
John Richards, and Samuel Sewell, Associate
Justices) and the abolition of the old court,
helped the cause.</p>

<p class='c006'>In the January next following fifty persons
were indicted. All who were tried were acquitted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>except three, who were pardoned. All who were
not tried were discharged on the payment of
thirty shillings each. In the following May, when
a jail delivery had been decreed, one hundred
and fifty went forth.</p>

<h3 id='lofty' class='c011'><span class='sc'>Lofty Character of the Condemned <br /> Judge Joseph Story’s Tribute</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>Those who suffered were a remarkable company
of men and women. They came from the humble
walks in life, but most of them were old in experience
and solidified in character and sentiments.
Though they were posted as criminals, taunted
with aspersions, forbidden counsel in law and
religion, and had every word of defense twisted
into a semblance of condemnation, yet they exhibited
the true nobility of life in truth and
righteousness; they counted their lives not dear
to them, could they only reach the goal of their
hope in God their Saviour.</p>

<p class='c006'><a id='tribute'></a>But after all we must not judge the actors in this
frenzied delusion harshly or rashly. Hon. Joseph
Story, Associate Justice of the United States
Supreme Court, writes: “Surely our ancestors
had no special reason for shame in a belief which
had the universal sanction of their own and all
former ages, which counted in its train philosophers
as well as enthusiasts, which was graced by
the learning of prelates as well as by the countenance
of kings, which the law supported by its
mandates, and the purest judges felt no compulsions
in enforcing.”</p>

<div id='il12'  class='figleft id007'>
<img src='images/image069.jpg' alt='Map of the homestead' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c012'>This map
delineates a
part of the
homestead
of Mrs. Eliza
Howe Perley,
now in her
ninety-third
year (May
15) whose residence
is at
“6.” The ascent
of the
estate is: Mrs. Perley’s father, Aaron Howe;
his second cousin, Joseph Howe; Joseph’s father,
Abraham Howe; his father, Abraham Howe, Jr.;
his cousins, Abigail and Mary Howe; their
father, James Howe, Jr.; his father, James Howe,
Sr.,—a continuous Howe ownership of two hundred
sixty years.</p>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>The house pictured on the opposite page stood
at “2,” and was built, probably, in 1711, since
Abraham Howe, Jr., bought the land in February
of that year, “to set a house upon.”</p>

<p class='c006'>James Howe, Jr., owned “a small house in the
orchard,” “3,” and a third of other “housing,”
which may have included “the old house,” that
stood in 1711, “near” “5” south of “2,” “the
southwest corner of the orchard.”</p>

<p class='c006'>While searching the records of deeds, the writer
noted a course in a description: “Thence to the
gate opposite James Howe, Junior’s.” The
locality was well known to him, and that knowledge
located the gate. He had often seen a gate
there, between 1840 and 1850. It swung at the
entrance of the avenue leading to the residence
of James Howe, Senior, marked “gate” on the
map. That fact was tangible; Mrs. Howe’s
home was at “2” on the map or near it.</p>

<p class='c006'>Thus far and no farther, till one day looking
over the ground back of the present residence
of Mrs. Eliza Howe Perley, “6” on the map, the
writer noticed a peculiar hollow in the otherwise
level surface, and to his question, What made it?
she replied, “I don’t know; I have always heard
it called Mary’s hole.” He immediately exclaimed,
“Mary Howe, daughter of the witch.”</p>

<p class='c006'>His conclusion: There the surviving daughters,
Mary and Abigail, lived, secluded and alone,
beneath the shadow of the cruel attainder.
After the death of Mary, their home became
Mary’s cellar; and when all appearance of a
cellar was gone, it became “Mary’s hole.”
To-day there is not the slightest vestige of
“Mary’s hole”; the old home, known only to the
saddest pages of New England history, is arable
ground.</p>

  <h2 id='ipswich' class='c004'>DESCENDANTS OF JAMES HOWE <br /> IPSWICH HOWES—JAMES BRANCH <br /> <br /> <span class='small'>ARMA VIRUMQUE CANO</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c005'>James Howe, Jr., was son of James, Sen., of
Ipswich, County Essex, Mass., and grandson of
Robert, “who lived in Hatfield, Broad-Oak,
county Essex, England, where Sir Francis Barrington
lived in Woodrow-Green; James, son of
said Robert, lived in a place called Hackerill, or
Bockerill, in Bishop-Stortford—in the happy
and gracious reign of King James I.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The mention of Sir Francis’s name in this
connection suggests some particular attachment,
of which Mr. Howe had, no doubt, informed his
children, and which he wished them to remember
and cherish. Sir Francis’s family name went
into England with the Conqueror, 1066, as Du
Barentin. The old feudal burg and barony which
cradled the name, near Rouen, is now Barentin.
The Conqueror gave Baron Odo Du Barentin a
grant of land in county Essex and the descendant
office of ranger or keeper of the forest of Hatfield.
Early in the seventeenth century the name was
anglicized Barrington.</p>

<p class='c006'>The special mention of Sir Francis’s name,
noted above, could hardly indicate a family relation;
it may have been a correlation, as ranger
and subranger, or assistant, a lucrative station
of Sir Francis’s gift. The charge, a wolf’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>head, which has characterized the Howe arms
for centuries, suggests forests and an encounter.</p>

<h3 id='coats' class='c011'><span class='sc'>The Coat of Arms <br /> James, Jr., and Elizabeth</span></h3>

<p class='c012'>Of the arms
“<i>Gules</i> (red)
a chevron <i>argent</i>
(silver)
between three
cros-cros-lets
<i>or</i> (gold) three
wolves’ heads
of the same,”
said to have
“adorned the
walls of the
‘Wayside
Inn’ or Howe
Tavern, in Sudbury, for over a hundred and fifty
years,” “Ye wolfs are ye fams. Arms, ye cross,
for gt accts don by ye 1st El.,” who lived around
<span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1500, or the time of Henry VII or VIII.</p>

<p class='c006'>The seat of the family bearing
the above arms was in county
Warwick; the seat of Robert
Howe and the place of the
original Howe arms: “<i>Argent</i>
(silver) a chevron between
three wolves’ heads couped
<i>sable</i> (black)” was in county
Essex.</p>

<div  class='figright id009'>
<img src='images/image075b.jpg' alt='Coat of Arms' class='ig001' />
</div>

<p class='c006'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>If the query is now suggested, why did not our
James Howe claim a coat of arms if he were entitled
to one, this answer is persuasive if not
conclusive; so early created and so long unused,
it was forgotten; or maybe, in New England
practical home life its value was considered zero,
or negative.</p>

<p class='c006'>It may be said, further, that the Howe coat
armor, the Howe family, the Barrington family,
and the King’s forest—each and all—belonged
to Hatfield, county Essex, and it may be thought
strange that the ancient Howe arms should not
include our James, the immigrant, in its descent.
On the whole, there is a preponderating impression
that the wolf’s head on the Howe arms was
captured in the Hatfield forest by a Howe.</p>

<p class='c006'><a id='jameshowesr'></a>James Howe, Sr., was of Roxbury, and made
freeman May 17, 1637, and removed to Ipswich
before 1648. He was granted June 11, 1650, on
motion of Mr. Norton, one of the farms of a
hundred acres formerly reserved for Mr. Norton’s
friends. He bought, July 3, 1651, about twenty-one
acres adjoining to Mr. Winthrop’s and Mr.
Symonds’s farms. He was a commoner, 1641;
a tithing man, 1671. His wife, Elizabeth Dane,
only daughter of John Dane, of Roxbury, died
Jan. 21, 1693-4. Both joined the church at
Topsfield in 1684.</p>

<p class='c006'>He was eminently an all round man. He was
a weaver by trade, but he could butcher a swine
or write a will or deed; he could practice in probate
or dig a grave; he could make a coffin or
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>build a house; he could cultivate a farm or survey
it; he could shoe a horse or an ox or make his
own or others’ shoes; he was a ready helper
in every department of country life. He died
May 17, 1701-2,<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c009'><sup>[4]</sup></a> at the age of one hundred and
four years, a man of three centuries.</p>

<p class='c006'><a id='jameshowejr'></a>James Howe, Jr., was born in Roxbury, in 1635
or 1636, since he was “about 30” in 1666 and
“about 34,” Sept. 28, 1669. He married, April 13,
1658, Elizabeth Jackson, a neighbor, daughter of
William and Joanna, of Rowley, and sister to
Mary, who married Wm. Foster, of Boxford, and
to Deborah, who married Lieut. John Trumble, of
Newbury, official men in their respective towns.</p>

<p class='c006'>He had a share in Plum Island, 1664; was a
voter, 1679; at about fifty years of age was blind,
so he had to be led. His will is dated Nov. 19,
1701. He confirms to his daughter Elizabeth
Jackson’s children, what he had given her; mentions
his daughter Deborah and grandson James
“when 21” and granddaughters Martha How and
Sarah How “when 18 or married.” He gave his
other two daughters, Mary and Abigail, “for their
pains and care that they have taken of me for several
years and their labor for my maintenance,”
my house, barn, orchard, lands, and movables,
and appointed them executrices. He signed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>will “James How,” but it was proved, March 11,
1701-2, as the will of James Howe, Jr. He died
Feb. 15, 1701. Their children were:</p>

    Martha, 1691; Sarah, 1692-3; who married Thomas Wood; James, 1695, ancestor of the

</div>

<p class='c012'>839 pages; printed page, 4¼ × 7½ inches; 5
dozen full page portraits; 280 illustrations; all
handwork binding; index to every proper name;
biography covers two thirds of the book; weight,
4¾ lbs.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Favorable Comment</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>The N. E. Historical-Genealogical Register
says, “So copious are the details respecting
nearly every member of the family that the work
may be described as a Biographical Genealogy.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Maj. E. T. Bouvé, Mass., compiler of war
records, writes: “Your very fine genealogy....
The information is of great importance to me.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Sutton Reference Library, Mass., ordered
a copy for approval or return. It was not returned;
a check was sent in payment.</p>

<p class='c006'>The <cite>Essex Antiquarian</cite> says: “A more interesting
family history has not been published.”</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>Family Pride</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>Family pride is a commendable trait, like
national pride or patriotism. The book is the
story of the family, male and female, and cannot
fail to awaken the just pride of all loyal members.
They can write in it their own families as years
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>make them, and leave priceless heirlooms to their
posterities.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>A History</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>Don’t be deceived. The book is not the ordinary
genealogy of dates and names. It is a <em>history</em>;
it reads like a history. There are more
than five dozen portraits with their biographies;
numerous examples of unsurpassed bravery, as
witness there doubt of Bunker Hill, the Pigwacket
of Captain Lovewell and the War of 1812; and of
patriotism, as witness the wars for the mother
country; as colonists; against her, as revolutionists,
and as defenders of our home government in the
Civil War.</p>

<p class='c006'>It has its Wandering Jew, its Country’s Wonder,
its escapades in courtship, its triumphs in politics,
and its stories of pioneering and of country-wide
travel. It shows how the family’s money built
churches and schools; how ministers, doctors,
lawyers, and teachers were ornaments to their
professions; how statesmen, by efficiency and integrity,
enjoyed repeated elections; and how men
“with the hoe,” the trowel, the saw, and other
implements of their craft, by diligence, enterprise,
and sobriety, reared happy homes and garnered
wealth.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>An Inspiration</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>The book is an inspiration. Squire H—— wrote,
“I read a chapter in the Perley History every
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>day,” meaning to say that every chapter has its
peculiar interest, pleasure, and uplifting sentiment.
Mrs. W—— bought six copies, Mrs. H——
four, both saying, “I want each of my children to
have a copy.” Other buyers have done relatively
the same.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>A Splendid Gift</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>Take a copy with you to “the old folks at
home” at Thanksgiving; it would gratify them.
Give one to your daughter at “sweet sixteen,” and
to your son at twenty-one. It would be a magnificent
present for a dear friend. Your Public
Library would write you a letter of cordial thanks
for a copy. As a <span class='sc'>New Year’s</span>, a <span class='sc'>Birthday</span>, a
<span class='sc'>Wedding</span>, or a <span class='sc'>Christmas</span> gift, it would crown
the occasion with proud delight.</p>

<p class='c006'>The books are in patent corrugated wrappers,
and can be ready for the mail in five minutes after
receiving your order.</p>

<h4 class='c016'><span class='sc'>For Libraries</span></h4>

<p class='c012'>The numerous intermarriages with old New England
families, and its fulness of biography, make
it a valuable addition to libraries, and Genealogical
and Historical Societies.</p>

</div>

<p class='c012'>(1) Gen. Geo. Washington was born on Friday,
Feb. 11, 1731-2.</p>

<p class='c006'>(2) A transit of Venus occurred, in 1639, on
Sunday, Dec. 6 (almanac); Dec. 4 (astronomy);
Nov. 24 (another astronomy).</p>

<p class='c006'>(3) Bryan, the 175th monarch of Ireland died
Good Friday, 1714. Durham Cathedral, England,
was struck by lightning, “The night before
the day of Corpus Christi, 1429.” Thomas
Ryhale dated his will, “Vigil of Easter, 1427.”</p>

<p class='c006'>The Chart is adapted to the styles: Julian,
Russian, Dionysian, Gregorian, Old and New.</p>

<p class='c006'>With a little primary arithmetic it furnishes
the date of Easter for any year.</p>

<p class='c006'>It gives the day of the week corresponding to
any possible date in 4,000 years, beginning,
Saturday, Jan. 1, <span class='fss'>A.D.</span> 1.</p>

<p class='c006'>One can easily determine the Friday occurrences
of great men and events, and so determine
the proportion of unlucky Fridays.</p>

<p class='c006'>Lawyers, historians, genealogists, teachers, and
all students and readers of history would find
the Chart eminently serviceable. For a number
of weeks in 1892 the Boston <cite>Transcript</cite> discussed
the four elements of dates; this Chart would have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>given the result in ten minutes. See the <cite>Transcript</cite>,

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope

works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the

  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply

obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution

additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty

  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than

from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
